=== Cell Values

This module supports setting basic and custom types to cell values. The following types are supported out of the box:

* String
* Calendar
* Date
* Double
* Boolean

Support for additional types can be easily added without the need to convert your custom objects each time.

=== Custom Renderers

You can register a custom cell renderer to marshal your custom type into a type that is supported by Excel.

[source,groovy]
.MyCustomClass.groovy
----
class MyCustomClass {
    String name
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
import com.jameskleeh.excel.Excel

//Register a renderer for your class
Excel.registerCellRenderer(MyCustomClass) { MyCustomClass c ->
    c.name
}
----

Now when you are making calls to `cell()`, you can pass your entire `MyCustomClass` instance as the value and it will be converted to just use the name.

[source,groovy]
----
def c = new MyCustomClass(name: "Sally")

ExcelBuilder.build {
    sheet {
        row(c) //The value "Sally" will be put into cell A1
    }
}
----
